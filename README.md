Data developed and used in the submission "On McEliece type cryptosystems using large minimum distance punctured codes from self-dual codes"

Content: 

- A generator matrix G_1064_532_nonsystematic of a binary [1064, 532, d &ge; 162] code constructed in the sumbission.
  The matrix G_1064_532_systematic is a generator matrix in systematic form of the same code.
